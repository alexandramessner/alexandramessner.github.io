        <p>The Hideout Coffee Co is a small local coffee house located in he heart of San Luis Obispo. We serve fresh coffee hand roasted on the premise and delicious locally sourced teas. Our menu offers a variety of breakfast dishes made fresh to order. The Hideout Coffee Co is the vision of a few locals who wanted to create a space to hang out with friends and family and meet new friends while enjoying the best coffee in town. We built the coffee house with the locals in mind while intending to capture the vibe of San Luis Obispo.</p>
